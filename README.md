# Overview
This tutorial presents a series of ``iLipidome`` functions that facilitate a comprehensive comparison of lipid profiles using a novel substructure-based approach. iLipidome is an innovative method that leverages the lipid biosynthetic network to analyze lipidomics data, taking into account the interdependence and interconnectedness of measured lipids. It provides 'Lipid Substructure Analysis' functionality, allowing users to decompose lipids into substructures, convert lipid expression into substructure expression, reconstruct the lipid biosynthetic network, and identify significant altered lipid pathways and their genetic origins. iLipidome currently supports "two-group comparison" and performs substructure analysis based on fatty acids, lipid species, or lipid classes, enabling comprehensive comparisons of lipid profiles across different levels. Our goal is to empower researchers with a deeper understanding of the intricate changes in lipidomics observed across various samples.


# How to install

1. Make sure you have the `devtools` R package. If you do not already have it installed, install it using `install.packages("devtools")`.
2. Run `devtools::install_github("LewisLabUCSD/iLipidome-package")` in R to install the iLipidome package, and you're done!
