Description: Numerous biological processes and diseases are influenced by lipid
    composition. Advances in lipidomics are elucidating their roles, but 
    analyzing and interpreting lipidomics data at the systems level remain 
    challenging. To address this, we present iLipidome, a method for analyzing 
    lipidomics data in the context of the lipid biosynthetic network, thus 
    accounting for the interdependence of measured lipids. iLipidome enhances 
    statistical power, enables reliable clustering and lipid enrichment 
    analysis, and links lipidomic changes to their genetic origins. We applied 
    iLipidome to investigate mechanisms driving changes in cellular lipidomes 
    following supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and successfully 
    identified the genetic causes of alterations. We further demonstrated how 
    iLipidome can disclose enzyme-substrate specificity and pinpoint prospective
    glioblastoma therapeutic targets. Finally, iLipidome enabled us to explore 
    underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and could guide the 
    discovery of early lipid biomarkers. Thus, iLipidome can assist researchers 
    studying the essence of lipidomic data and advance the field of lipid 
    biology.
